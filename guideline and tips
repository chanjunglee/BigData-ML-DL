# knn (supervisor)

# K nearest neighbor(init, knn) is literally to classify data by the degree of distance from k value.
# simply, if new data inputs into the model, it's gathered the nearest data and they're bound as the same group.
# in this model, the point is to find the most profit k-value for classifying to data well
# (we gatta avoid to overfitting or underfitting. there are several ways to decide over(under)fitting. 
#  but those tips are gonna be differ depending on each models)
